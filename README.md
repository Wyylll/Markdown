# How to convert decimal into binary 
## This is for students just starting Digital Systems
The concept I am picking is converting decimal into binary. This subject took me a while to understand so I think I am the perfect person to explain this concept. So that being said let us begin. The explanation when you google ‘how to convert decimal into binary’ is “Step 1: Divide the given decimal number by 2 and note down the remainder. Step 2: Now, divide the obtained quotient by 2, and note the remainder again. Step 3: Repeat the above steps until you get 0 as the quotient.” Now that we know how google wants us to do the conversion let’s see if I can explain it simpler. For me my way may take longer but it is easier. So I see it as every new binary digit is another power of 2. So that looks like 2 to the zeroth power which is 1 and then it goes on from that. So look at a number like 67. So you look at that like well 2 to the 6th power is 64 so now that we have 64 we have to get the 3 remainders so 2 to the first power is 2 that makes 66 and two to the zeroth power is 1 and that gives us 67 so binary for 67 would be 1000011.
