## In depth 
Now that I have gave you a little piece of my life let's go in depth on how I really made it out here to Missouri. It was not to come to Mizzou I did not just move in with family I had living here I actually have no family in missouri which is kinda wild but none the less here is my story. 



It all started my junior of highschool in Sacramento my friend Austin told me he met another Austin playing basketball at the park. I was like "okay?" little did I know this kid 8 years later would convince me to drop my life and move to missouri but I'm getting ahead of myself here. So my parents in June of 2020 decided they wanted to move back to Ohio where they are originally from. So I went with them I did not like it there and my friend Austin was trying to convince me to move in with him in St Charles. I came out to visit and at first I was like name this is not the place for me but after a couple of weeks I was like why not? A year goes by and I decided to move out to Columbia to attend Mizzou so here I am.
